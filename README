Puprpose~
Ensure my favorite keymap is always available by overwriting plugin-defined
keymap with my buffer local keymap.

I know this plugin is not perfect solution, but I think this still useful.

Practical usecase~
For example, I use following keymap to move between windows.  
>
    nnoremap <silent> <C-h> :wincmd h<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> <C-l> :wincmd l<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> <C-k> :wincmd k<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> <C-j> :wincmd j<CR>
<

With this keymap, I can move window to window with <C-hlkj>.
But sometime, plugin I installed overwrite one of these keymap.  
To ensure `<C-hlkj>` combination is always available, set buffer local keymap 
after plugin have set up their keymap.  
This could be done with `autocmd Filetype`, but setup this autocmd each time I
install new plugin is nonsense.  

To do that, refer |fthook-examples| in help.
